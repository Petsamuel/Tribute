            Fela Anklápó Kuti (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15, 1938 – August 2, 1997) was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, composer, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. He is widely considered as the father of Afrobeat, an African music genre that fuses West African music with American funk and jazz. At his peak, he was described as one of Africa's most "difficult and charismatic music performers."  According to All Music, he is a musical and sociopolitical voice of international relevance. <br>

 Kuti was the son of a Protestant minister, Reverend Ransome-Kuti. His mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist.
As a child, Kuti learned piano and drums, and led his school choir. In the 1950s, Kuti told his parents that he was moving to London, England, to study medicine, but wound up attending the Trinity College of Music instead. While at Trinity, Kuti studied classical music and developed an awareness of American jazz.

           <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">
            Kuti attended Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1958, he was sent to London to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, with the trumpet being his preferred instrument.[5] While there, he formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife.[12] In 1960, Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he had three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola).
          </p  >
          <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> In 1983, Kuti nominated himself for president in Nigeria's first elections in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Kuti created a new band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such. Kuti stated in an interview: "Stressing the point that I have to make Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the African. So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to Egypt 80.</p>

            <h3>Political Activism</h4>
          During his nearly one-year stay in the United States, Kuti and his band, the Koola Lobitos, became enamored with the beliefs and philosophies of various Black Power activists, particularly members of the Black Panther Party (BPP).
The Afrobeat musician began to create songs with themes of black struggle and pride. His experiences in the United States also pushed him farther into the field of political action when he returned to Nigeria.
The band's name was changed from Koola Lobitos to Fela Ransome Kuti & the Africa '70, which resulted in considerable alterations in the band's attitude. Kuti began writing politically charged lyrics critical of the continent's numerous military regimes in the early 1970s.

Throughout his life, he lamented the irreparable harm that European colonial control in Africa had done to Africans' economic and social lives.
He also saw corrupt and authoritarian regimes across the continent as both a cause and a symptom of chronic poverty and unemployment, which widened the gap between the ultra-rich and the poor.
He was detained numerous times in Nigeria for his political involvement, with the longest of his prison sentence coming in 1984, when he spent roughly 20 months behind bars.</p>
           <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> <h3> Influence</h4>
          Kuti's songs were warmly accepted not just in Nigeria, but across Africa in the years that followed. He stayed true to his Yoruba and African heritage, singing in Nigerian Pidgin English and a little Yoruba.
Despite soon becoming a popular figure in Nigeria's music business, his loud criticism of the military earned him the enmity of then-military head of state General Olusegun Obasanjo.
The police often raided his Kalakuta colony in Lagos, as well as his other residences. Almost every raid resulted in Kuti and his band mates being attacked and briefly detained. Despite this, he continued to oppose the military administration and the horrors committed in Biafra throughout the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970).

However, the authorities raided his nightclub (the Shrine) in certain occasions because he publicly advocated the usage of marijuana, which is illegal in Nigeria.
          </p  >
          <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> One of the biggest artists to draw immense inspiration from Afrobeat king Fela Kuti is Burna Boy. The Nigerian musical icon who has collaborated with some global superstars, including Beyoncé, has on numerous occasions mentioned that he religiously listens to Fela Kuti’s songs.

Kuti was a true master showman when he performed on stage. He often described his performance on stage as an “Underground Spiritual Game” that allowed him to communicate the true spirit and identity of Africa to the rest of the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> <h3>Fela Kuti’s Kalakuta Republic</h3>
Kalakuta Republic was established a few kilometers from Lagos's city center to serve as a safe haven for like-minded musicians, artists, and political activists.
The Afrobeat musician's compound provided all of the necessary amenities for his band to thrive and sustain pressure on Nigeria's then-military administration. Kuti's Kalakuta Republic had a successful recording studio, a hotel (the Empire Hotel), a nightclub, and a health center in addition to housing for his family and band members.
The Afrika Shrine, Kuti's nightclub, featured numerous of his concerts as well as other Yoruba traditional festivities..</p>
