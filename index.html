                 <h3 style="margin-top:50px ;">BRIEF</h3> Fela Anklápó Kuti (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15, 1938 – August 2, 1997) was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, composer, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. He is widely considered as the father of Afrobeat, an African music genre that fuses West African music with American funk and jazz. At his peak, he was described as one of Africa's most "difficult and charismatic music performers."  According to All Music, he is a musical and sociopolitical voice of international relevance. <br>  </p>     
          <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">In 1978, he married 27 women at the same time, demonstrating his support for polygamy. He eventually came to feel that marriage was a "imposition" and divorced all of his wives, despite switching to a rotating method of retaining 12 spouses at the same time. His treatment of women (both in his music and in his personal life) has been scrutinized, with accusations of sexism thrown against him.
On August 2, 1997, he died in Lagos, Nigeria, of AIDS complications. Three days of processions and a public service were held in his honor.</p>

            <h3>Major Work</h4>
          <li>His album ‘Zombie’ (1977) remains a classic, all the more powerful for the disproportionate state response it solicited.</li> 
<li>The singles ‘Coffin for Head of State’ and ‘Unknown Soldier’ were written in response to his mother’s death at the hands of the military.</li> 
<li>He attacked the ‘ITT Corporation’ and the military again with his iconic single ‘I.T.T. (International Thief Thief).’</li> 
<li>The 1989 album ‘Beasts of No Nation’ was a response to remarks by the erstwhile South African president and has now become a pan-African political landmark.</li>
          </p>
           <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> <h3> Career</h4>
        <li>Kuti formed his first band, ‘Koola Lobitos,’ while in college. After moving back to Nigeria in 1963, he re-formed the band, trained as a radio producer, and worked with trumpeter Victor Olaiya.</li>
        <li>He first came up with Afrobeat during a trip to Ghana in 1967. The trip was undertaken to help him think of a new musical direction.</li>
        <li>In 1977, he, along with and ‘Afrika ‘70,’ released ‘Zombie,’ a politically charged piece that decried the methods of the Nigerian military. Although exceedingly popular with the public, this album invited swift and terrible backlash from the government, which sent 1000 soldiers to attack the ‘Kalakuta Republic,’ destroyed his property, injured Kuti, and threw his elderly mother from a window. His mother later succumbed to her injuries, prompting Kuti to deliver her coffin to a Nigerian general’s residence and composing two more songs criticizing the government.</li>
        <li>In 1978, he performed at two notable concerts: one in Accra, which led to him being banned from Ghana, and the other in Berlin, after which most of his troupe left him due to concerns about financial recklessness. During this period, he also changed his middle name to Anikulapo (“He who carries death in his pouch”) and dropped the last name, ‘Ransome,’ which he believed was a slave name.</li>
        <li>After his return from Europe, he moved to Ikeja and set up a new club, which became a hotbed for drug activities. The anti-Fela sentiment within the government reached a new peak at this time, prompting him to establish his own political party, ‘Movement of the People’ (MOP), and run for president. His candidature was rejected, and the military overthrew the civilian government and resumed its harassment of the musician.</li>
        <li>He continued to make music through the 1980s, performing in a notable ‘Amnesty International’ concert in New Jersey and releasing ‘Beasts of No Nation’ just before the abolition of apartheid in South Africa.
His health began failing in the early 1990s. After being arrested in 1993 again, for murder, with three of his ‘Afrika ‘70’ bandmates, Kuti slowed down and began producing less music, leaving his son, Femi to continue his legacy.</li>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 style ='margin:10px'> About Fela Kuti’s Kalakuta Republic</h3>
Kalakuta Republic was established a few kilometers from Lagos's city center to serve as a safe haven for like-minded musicians, artists, and political activists.
The Afrobeat musician's compound provided all of the necessary amenities for his band to thrive and sustain pressure on Nigeria's then-military administration. Kuti's Kalakuta Republic had a successful recording studio, a hotel (the Empire Hotel), a nightclub, and a health center in addition to housing for his family and band members.
The Afrika Shrine, Kuti's nightclub, featured numerous of his concerts as well as other Yoruba traditional festivities..</p>
